## Submitting Issues
Please complete the form using the bug_report template on the Issues page of Github. Fill in as much information as possible, but not every field is mandatory.
 
## Proposing features 
Discuss with team members first. If ageed upon, create a card on Zube.io.

## Branches
New features must be done in a new branch titled 'feature/[name]'. Once complete, merge into the Develop branch.  
Developing directly to the Develop branch is not recomended. Release and Master must NOT be developed in.

## Testing 
Please carry out unit testing alongside your work. Furthermore, integration testing must be carried out,
  this is not required for every change but when your code affects multiple components.
